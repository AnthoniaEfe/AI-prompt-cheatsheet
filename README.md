# AI Prompt Engineering Cheat Sheet
A practical, beginner-friendly cheat sheet for writing clear, structured, and effective prompts for large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
This resource was created as part of my learning-in-public journey to move from using AI casually to using it intentionally and professionally.

## What’s inside
- Core prompt patterns (role, context, constraints, examples)
- Techniques to improve clarity, accuracy, and consistency
- Prompt structures for explaining complex ideas simply
- Practical examples you can reuse and adapt

## Who this is for
- Developers and technical professionals
- Students and educators
- Anyone looking to get more reliable results from AI tools

## Why this exists
- Most AI issues come from poor prompt structure, not the model itself.
- This cheat sheet focuses on how to think about prompting, not just what to type.

## Status
- Feedback, suggestions, and improvements are welcome.
